# Color-Classification-and-Recycling-Bin-Detection

School project for ECE-276A - Sensing and Estimation in Robotics at UC San Diego.

Project uses Python to create a color classifier using logistic regression. This color classifier is then used to detect recycling bins from images. Report in pdf form can be found in the repo detailing the process and results.
